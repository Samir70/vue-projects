## Lights Out
Puzzle. My first Vue app, it only took a couple of hours one Saturday morning. [Lights Out (Vue)](https://samir70.github.io/vue-projects/vue-lights-out.html)

This version was written to support a recent job interview. The company was modernising their technology -- translating it into vue. So I translated one of my own apps.
